## About

Picky Flyer allows users to browse a database of flights by an aircraft of their choice. User can either look up flights by a specific route and date, flights departing a specific airport to anywhere, or by choosing an aircraft from a list. Each of the methods returns a list of available flights and Skyscanner API is used to look up prices for these flights. If price is not found, user is given a custom built link to an alternative flight search provider. The website was built with React.
